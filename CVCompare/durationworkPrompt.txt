Consider the following sentences:

Sentence 1: {rule}
Sentence 2: {cv}

By using your analytical knowledge, if we consider {rule} as the reference sentence, does the time duration of {cv} satisfy the time duration given in the reference sentence? If it satisfies then output "The rule is fulfilled". Else output "The rule is not fulfilled".
Please do not give any other explanations or wordings as the output. Only use the wordings provided.
