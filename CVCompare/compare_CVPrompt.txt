 Imagine you are an expert Answer Providing System. Your task is to determine if the text of the given JSON file within '<<<' and '>>>' tags satisfies the rules specified within the '<rules>' and '</rules>' tags.

  To the place of 'rules', the rules will be provided as a list of rules in the JSON format. Provide the final output in the following JSON format which includes all rules provided in the list of rules:

  ```
{{
  "Rule 1": {{
      "RuleType": "<Insert Rule type>",
      "Rule": "<Insert Rule>",
      "Entry": "<Insert Rule Entry>",
      "Logic": "<Insert Rule Logic>",
      "CorrespondingText": "<Insert Text>",
      "RuleStatus": "<Insert Rule Status>"
    }},
  "Rule 2": {{
      "RuleType": "<Insert Rule type>",
      "Rule": "<Insert Rule>",
      "Entry": "<Insert Rule Entry>",
      "Logic": "<Insert Rule Logic>",
      "CorrespondingText": "<Insert Text>",
      "RuleStatus": "<Insert Rule Status>"
    }},
  "Rule 3": {{
      "RuleType": "<Insert Rule type>",
      "Rule": "<Insert Rule>",
      "Entry": "<Insert Rule Entry>",
      "Logic": "<Insert Rule Logic>",
      "CorrespondingText": "<Insert Text>",

      Company Name: Plant Sciences Dept.. Position Held: Lecturer. JoinedDate: 01/12/2020. ResignedDate: 01/09/2023."
  - Analysis:
      You are given the following input:
      Work Experience1:
       "CompanyName": "Microbiology Dept.",
       "JoinedDate": "01/01/2018",
       "PositionHeld": "Research Assistant",
       "Resigned": true,
       "ResignedDate": "01/09/2020"
      Work Experience2:
       "CompanyName": "Plant Sciences Dept.",
       "JoinedDate": "01/12/2020",
       "PositionHeld": "Lecturer",
       "Resigned": true,
       "ResignedDate": "01/09/2023"
 
      Step 1: Now let us check whether Requirement 1 is satisfied.
      Company Name: Microbiology Dept.. Position Held: Research Assistant. According to Rule Entry, Microbiology is a related field of Biology.
      Company Name: Plant Sciences Dept.. Position Held: Lecturer. According to rule, Plant Sciences is a related field of Biology.
      Both entries satisfy the field given in the rule. Hence Requirement 1 is satisfied by both work experiences.
     
      Step 2: Now let us check whether Requirement 2 is satisfied.
      Lets calculate the total time duration of the work experiences.
      Work Experience 1:
      - Joined Date: 01/01/2018 which when converted to month and year is January 2018.
      - Resigned Date: 01/09/2020 which when converted to month and year is September 2020.
      - Total time duration between Joined Date and Resigned Date of Work Experience 1 is 2 years and 8 months.
      Work Experience 2:
      - Joined Date: 01/12/2020 which when converted to month and year is December 2020.
      - Resigned Date: 01/09/2023 which when converted to month and year is September 2023.
      - Total time duration between Joined Date and Resigned Date of Work Experience 2 is 2 years and 9 months.
      Since all work experiences satisfys Requirement 1, we have to calculate the aggragated time duration of them.
      When this calculation is done, for this scenario we get the following:
      Total time duration: 2 years and 8 months, 2 years and 9 months aggrgates to 5 years and 5 months.
      - According to the Rule Logic, the aggregate time duration needs to be more than 5 years.
     
      Step 3: The Total Time duration is 5 years and 5 months. Mathematically, 5 years and 5 months is more than 5 years.
      Therefore, the rule is fulfilled.
  - Rule Status: The rule is fulfilled.
 
  ##Example 11:

      - Resigned Date: 01/09/2022 which when converted to month and year is September 2022.
      - Total time duration between Joined Date and Resigned Date of Work Experience 1 is 4 years and 8 months.
      Since work experience 1 satisfies Requirement 1, we have to calculate the aggragated time duration of them.
      When this calculation is done, for this scenario we get the following:
      Total time duration: 4 years and 8 months aggrgates to 4 years and 8 months.
      - According to the Rule Logic, the aggregate time duration needs to be more than 3 years.
     
      Step 3: The Total Time duration is 4 years and 8 months. Mathematically, 4 years and 8 month5 is more than 3 years.
      Therefore, the rule is fulfilled.
  - Rule Status: The rule is fulfilled.

      Step 1: Now let us check whether requirement 1 is satisfied.
      Company Name: Microbiology Dept.. Position Held: Research Assistant. According to Rule Entry, Microbiology is not in the field of Statistics and is not related.
      Company Name: Plant Sciences Dept.. Position Held: Lecturer. According to rule, Plant Sciences is in the field of Statistics and is not related.
      Both entries does not satisfy the field given in the rule. Hence Requirement 1 is not satisfied by both work experiences.
     
      Since Step 1 is not satisfied, we move to Step 3.
      Step 3: the rule is not fulfilled.
  - Rule Status: The rule is not fulfilled.
