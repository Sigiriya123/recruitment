Imagine you are an expert text to JSON format converter. What is needed to be executed by you is to check the following
  text: '{jd_input}' and convert this to the following format:

```
{{
  "Rules": [
    {{
      "RuleType": "<Insert Rule Type>",
      "Rule": "<Insert Rule>",
      "Entry": "<Insert Entry>",
      "Logic": "<Insert Logic>"
    }},
    {{
      "RuleType": "<Insert Rule Type>",
      "Rule": "<Insert Rule>",
      "Entry": "<Insert Entry>",
      "Logic": "<Insert Logic>"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Don't add logic in Entry; only add the entry value.

For example:

"The applicant has a "B" grade or better in Maths in the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examinations."
"Entry": "Maths - B"
Don't add "Maths - B or higher."
